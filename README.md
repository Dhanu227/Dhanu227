## 🚀 Projects
# **Projects Portfolio**

### **1. Churn Prediction with ANN**  
This project predicts customer churn for a bank using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based on customer demographics, account activity, and transaction history.
#### **Features**
- Preprocessed dataset with features like `CreditScore`, `Age`, `Balance`, and `Geography`.
- Built an ANN model for binary classification and monitored with **TensorBoard**.
- Saved the model as a **pickle** file and deployed with a **Streamlit** app for real-time predictions.
#### **Tech Stack**
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Streamlit  
- **Tools**: TensorBoard  
#### **Run the App**
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
  https://github.com/Dhanu227/Churn-Prediction-ANN- 

### **2. Kindle Sentiment Analysis**  
This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews of Kindle products using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand customer satisfaction and highlight key product features.
#### **Features**
- Preprocessed textual data using libraries like **spaCy** and **NLTK**.  
- Performed sentiment analysis to classify reviews into positive, neutral, and negative categories.  
- Visualized results using **WordCloud** and other plotting tools for insights.  
#### **Tech Stack**
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: spaCy, NLTK, Pandas, Matplotlib
