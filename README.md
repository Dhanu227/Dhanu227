## üöÄ Projects
# **Projects Portfolio**

### **1. Churn Prediction with ANN**  
This project predicts customer churn for a bank using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based on customer demographics, account activity, and transaction history.
#### **Features**
- Preprocessed dataset with features like `CreditScore`, `Age`, `Balance`, and `Geography`.
- Built an ANN model for binary classification and monitored with **TensorBoard**.
- Saved the model as a **pickle** file and deployed with a **Streamlit** app for real-time predictions.
#### **Tech Stack**
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Streamlit  
- **Tools**: TensorBoard  
#### **Run the App**
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   https://github.com/Dhanu227/Churn-Prediction-ANN- 

### **2. Kindle Sentiment Analysis**  
This project performs sentiment analysis on a dataset of 982,619 Amazon Kindle product reviews from May 1996 to July 2014. The goal is to analyze review sentiments, helpfulness, and identify factors influencing review usefulness.
#### **Dataset**
Key columns include:
- **asin**: Product ID  
- **helpful**: Helpfulness rating (e.g., 2/3)  
- **overall**: Product rating  
- **reviewText**: Review content  
- **reviewerID**: Reviewer ID  
- **reviewTime**: Review timestamp
Data sourced from [Julian McAuley, UCSD](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/).
#### **Key Tasks**
- Sentiment analysis on review text  
- Analyze helpfulness ratings and factors influencing them  
- Detect fake reviews and outliers  
- Product rating analysis
#### **Tech Stack**
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, NLTK, spaCy  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebooks

### **3. Forest Fire Analysis**  
This project analyzes weather and environmental data from two regions of Algeria (Bejaia and Sidi Bel-abbes) to predict the occurrence of forest fires. The dataset includes 244 instances (122 per region) with 14 features related to weather and fire conditions.
#### **Dataset**
- **Features**: Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Rain, FWI components (FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI, BUI, FWI), etc.  
- **Output**: Fire (138) and Not Fire (106)  
- **Timeframe**: June to September 2012  
#### **Approach**
- Data cleaning, outlier detection, and feature scaling/standardization.
- Used regression models: **Linear Regression**, **Ridge**, **Lasso**, and **Elastic Net** to predict fire occurrences.
#### **Tech Stack**
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebooks
